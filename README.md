# MattyPit---KSPController
My Controller for Kerbal Space Program using the SimPit library.
The controller is based around a Arduino Mega 2560. 
I'm also using the ezButton library to help handle switch and button I/O.

All of the frame and controller panels were drawn in Fusion 360 and 3D printed on a Monoprice Mini V2.
The case panels were hand fabricated and fitted onto the outside of the frame using brass heat inserts.  The inserts allow for quick and easy removal of the panels for any maintence issues that may come up.

Here is a video of it in action!
